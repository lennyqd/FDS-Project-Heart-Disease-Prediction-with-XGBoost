Following these steps will help you replicate the preprocessing and postprocessing procedures for the dataset.
To replicate the preprocessing and postprocessing for this dataset, please follow these steps:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the "PROJECT_HEARTDISEASE" folder (Extract file if you have already did not).

2. Inside the "PROJECT_HEARTDISEASE" folder, locate and enter the "Pre-DataProcessing" folder. Once inside, open the "data_processing.ipynb" file.

3. In the Jupyter Notebook menu bar (the top bar), you'll find a "Cell" or "Run" section. Click on "Cell" or "Run".

4. Within the "Cell" section, select "Run All" to execute all the cells in the "data_processing.ipynb" file. This will ensure that you have all the necessary imports, settings, and files for this project.

4.1 If executed correctly, the file will run through all the cells, and the "Post-DataProcessing" folder should be updated and modified accordingly.

5. Close the "data_processing" file in Jupyter Notebook and return to the parent folder (PROJECT_HEARTDISEASE).

6. Open the "[PROJECT] Heart Disease Prediction with XGBoost.ipynb" file and repeat step 4 to reproduce the same dataset.
